# Notion on transparency

## For those who care

### First amendment:

Nothing particular here, but
**this is _extremely_ important!**

This was ***very*** important as well,
but we decided to ~~censor~~ part of it.

They said,
>look, that ain't transparent,
>that's elitistic

But we just don't _care_.

### Second amendment:

So be it.

Log, that is [pelican](ot1/commit/fe27f4cc54e6ef5143cd0356f99a5ce269e9a72b) in the turbine.
