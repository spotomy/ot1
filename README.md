# Notion on transparency

## For those who care

# First amendment:

Nothing particular here, but
**this is __extremely__ important!**

This was ***very*** important as well,
but we decided to ~~censor~~ part of it.

They said,
>look, that ain't transparent,
>that's elitistic

But we just don't __care__.

# Second amendment:

So be it.
